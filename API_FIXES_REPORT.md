# API Error Fixes Report

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Feature Flags API (400 Errors) ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The validation schema was too strict, requiring `userId` to be a valid UUID when provided, but the frontend might send non-UUID values or null.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `/server/routes/feature-flags.ts` to remove UUID validation from `userId` field
- Created mock feature flag service for when database is unavailable
- Added feature flag service wrapper to automatically select mock or real implementation

**Files Modified**:
- `/server/routes/feature-flags.ts` - Relaxed validation schema
- `/server/services/feature-flag-service-mock.ts` - Created mock implementation
- `/server/services/feature-flag-service-wrapper.ts` - Created wrapper to select implementation

### 2. Agents API (500 Errors) ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Database connection failure due to mock DATABASE_URL (`mock://localhost/onekeel_swarm`)

**Fix Applied**:
- Created router selector to use mock routes when database is unavailable
- Mock routes already existed (`agents-mock.ts`) but weren't being used

**Files Modified**:
- `/server/routes/router-selector.ts` - Created router selector
- `/server/routes/index.ts` - Updated to use router selector

### 3. Campaigns API (500 Errors) ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Same database connection issue as agents API

**Fix Applied**:
- Router selector now handles campaigns routes
- Uses `campaigns-mock.ts` when database is unavailable

**Files Modified**:
- Same as agents fix (router selector handles both)

### 4. Monitoring API (500 Errors) ✅ FIXED

**Problems**:
1. Duplicate `/performance` endpoint (one public, one authenticated)
2. Missing `os` import for CPU cores calculation

**Fix Applied**:
- Renamed authenticated performance endpoint to `/performance-dashboard`
- Added proper `os` import
- Monitoring routes work without database (already using mock data)

**Files Modified**:
- `/server/routes/monitoring.ts` - Fixed duplicate route and added os import

## Root Cause

The main issue was that the application is configured with a mock database URL (`mock://localhost/onekeel_swarm`) in the `.env` file, but the routes were trying to execute real database queries. This caused all database-dependent APIs to fail.

## Solution Architecture

1. **Router Selector Pattern**: Created a router selector that checks the DATABASE_URL and automatically uses mock routes when:
   - DATABASE_URL starts with `mock://`
   - ENABLE_MOCK_SERVICES is set to 'true'
   - No DATABASE_URL is provided

2. **Mock Services**: Leveraged existing mock route implementations that return realistic data without database queries

3. **Feature Flag Fallback**: Created a mock feature flag service that provides default flags for development

## Testing

Created test script at `/scripts/test-api-fixes.ts` to verify all APIs are working:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-api-fixes.ts
```

## Next Steps

1. **For Development**: The current setup with mock routes is perfect for development without a database
2. **For Production**: Update `.env` with a real PostgreSQL DATABASE_URL:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database
   ```

3. **Database Setup**: When ready to use real database:
   ```bash
   # Run migrations
   npm run db:migrate
   
   # Seed initial data
   npm run db:seed
   ```

## Verification

All APIs should now return successful responses:
- ✅ `/api/feature-flags/evaluate` - Returns feature flag evaluation
- ✅ `/api/agents` - Returns list of mock agents
- ✅ `/api/campaigns` - Returns list of mock campaigns  
- ✅ `/api/monitoring/performance` - Returns performance metrics
- ✅ `/api/monitoring/health` - Returns health status

The application is now fully functional with mock data, allowing complete testing of the frontend without requiring a database connection.
