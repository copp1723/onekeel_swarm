# Updated Build Process Documentation for Render

## Issue
The build was failing on Render due to React import issues, specifically:
- Error in `CampaignWizardWrapper.tsx`: "React refers to a UMD global, but the current file is a module"

## Solution
Created automated fixes to ensure proper React imports:

1. `tools/build-fixes/fix-react-imports.js` - Fixes React imports across the codebase
2. `tools/build-fixes/fix-campaign-wizard-wrapper.js` - Specifically addresses the CampaignWizardWrapper issue
3. `fix-build.sh` - Runs the fixes and then performs the build

## Updated Build Command for Render
Update your Render build command to:

```
chmod +x fix-build.sh && ./fix-build.sh
```

## What This Fixes
- Ensures all React imports are properly structured as ES modules
- Fixes the specific error with CampaignWizardWrapper.tsx
- Maintains the same build output structure

## Manual Verification
You can test this locally by running:

```bash
chmod +x fix-build.sh
./fix-build.sh
```

The build should complete successfully without any TypeScript errors.
