# PWA Icons Setup

The PWA icons are missing from the public directory. To fix the PWA manifest error:

1. Add these files to `/client/public/`:
   - `pwa-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixel icon
   - `pwa-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixel icon
   - `favicon.ico` - Favicon file

2. Or temporarily disable PWA in `vite.config.ts` by commenting out the VitePWA plugin.

The CSP fix has been implemented and should resolve the white screen issue once deployed.
