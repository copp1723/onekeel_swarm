# Database Schema Audit Report

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the current database schema for the OneKeel Swarm application. The audit includes an analysis of existing tables, columns, indexes, and identifies any missing elements that should be present according to the application requirements.

## Current Schema Analysis

### Core Tables

1. **users** - Authentication and access control
2. **clients** - Multi-tenant client management
3. **agent_configurations** - AI agent settings
4. **agent_templates** - Preconfigured agent templates
5. **leads** - Core business entity for lead management
6. **campaigns** - Marketing campaign definitions
7. **communications** - All interactions with leads
8. **templates** - Email/SMS templates
9. **campaign_steps** - Multi-step campaign definitions
10. **lead_campaign_enrollments** - Lead participation in campaigns
11. **sessions** - User authentication sessions
12. **conversations** - Chat/agent conversations
13. **audit_logs** - System audit trail
14. **analytics_events** - Custom event tracking
15. **feature_flags** - Feature visibility control
16. **feature_flag_user_overrides** - User-specific feature overrides

### Enums

1. **user_role** - admin, manager, agent, viewer
2. **lead_status** - new, contacted, qualified, converted, rejected
3. **channel** - email, sms, chat
4. **communication_direction** - inbound, outbound
5. **communication_status** - pending, sent, delivered, failed, received
6. **campaign_type** - drip, blast, trigger
7. **agent_type** - email, sms, chat, voice
8. **feature_flag_category** - agent-tuning, campaign-advanced, system-config, integrations, ui-progressive, debugging, experimental
9. **complexity** - basic, intermediate, advanced
10. **risk_level** - low, medium, high
11. **environment** - development, staging, production

## Missing Elements Analysis

### Missing Tables

After reviewing the current schema, all required tables appear to be present. However, the following tables might benefit from additional columns or indexes:

### Missing Columns

1. **leads table**:
   - `score` - Lead qualification score (0-100) to supplement existing `qualification_score`
   - `name` - Computed full name field using existing `first_name` and `last_name`
   - Note: `first_name` and `last_name` already exist in the schema

2. **campaigns table**:
   - `created_by` - UUID reference to user who created the campaign
   - `updated_by` - UUID reference to user who last updated the campaign

3. **lead_campaign_enrollments table**:
   - `enrolled_by` - UUID reference to user who enrolled the lead
   - `enrolled_at` - Timestamp when the lead was enrolled (note: `enrolled_at` already exists)

4. **communications table**:
   - `conversation_id` - UUID reference linking communication to a conversation thread

### Index Optimization Opportunities

1. **leads table**:
   - Add index on `score` column for performance
   - Add index on computed `name` column for search performance

2. **campaigns table**:
   - Add index on `created_by` column for performance
   - Add index on `updated_by` column for performance
   - Existing `active` and `type` indexes are already present

3. **communications table**:
   - Add index on `conversation_id` column for performance

4. **lead_campaign_enrollments table**:
   - Add index on `enrolled_by` column for performance

5. **Additional performance indexes**:
   - Composite indexes for common query patterns
   - Indexes for filtering and sorting operations

## Recommendations

### 1. Add Missing Columns

The identified missing columns should be added to improve data integrity and application functionality.

### 2. Create Additional Indexes

Adding the recommended indexes will improve query performance for common operations.

### 3. Data Migration

When adding new columns, consider data migration strategies for existing records.

## Rollback Procedures

All schema changes should be implemented with rollback procedures in mind:

1. Always create database backups before applying migrations
2. Ensure all migrations can be reversed
3. Test rollback procedures in a development environment
4. Document any data that may be lost during rollback

## Conclusion

The current database schema is well-structured and comprehensive. The identified missing columns and index opportunities are relatively minor and can be addressed through standard migration procedures. The existing validation utilities provide a good foundation for ongoing schema verification.
