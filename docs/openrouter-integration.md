# OpenRouter Auto-Select Integration

## Summary of Changes

We've simplified the Agent Configuration UI by removing complex advanced settings and implementing OpenRouter's auto-select feature. This makes the interface more user-friendly while ensuring optimal AI model selection.

### Changes Made:

1. **UI Simplification**
   - Removed temperature slider, max tokens input, and model dropdown
   - Renamed section to "Agent Capabilities" to focus on communication channels
   - Added a user-friendly explanation about AI technology

2. **Default Configuration**
   - Set default temperature to 70%
   - Set default max tokens to 500
   - Set API model to 'openrouter-auto' to use OpenRouter's automatic model selection

## Next Steps

### Backend Implementation

1. **OpenRouter Integration Updates**
   - Updated the `model-router.ts` file to handle the 'openrouter-auto' model value
   - Modified the OpenRouter health checker to test the auto-select capability
   - Implemented intelligent model routing based on task complexity
   - Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **OpenRouter Configuration**
   - Make sure the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable is set
   - Verify that the OpenRouter health check is passing

### Testing

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Create a new agent using the simplified UI
   - Verify that the agent works correctly with the auto-selected model
   - Monitor API calls to ensure the correct model selection is happening

2. **User Feedback**
   - Gather feedback on the simplified UI
   - Verify that the auto-selection provides appropriate models for different tasks

## Benefits

1. **Simplified User Experience**
   - Average users no longer need to understand complex AI parameters
   - Reduced cognitive load with fewer choices to make

2. **Optimized Performance**
   - OpenRouter automatically selects the best model for each task
   - Consistent performance without manual model selection

3. **Future-Proof**
   - As new models become available, they'll be automatically considered for selection
   - No need to update the UI when model options change

## Configuration

To enable OpenRouter's auto-select feature, ensure the following environment variables are set:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

This integration allows the system to automatically select the most appropriate model for each task, optimizing for cost, performance, and capabilities.
