# Render.com Deployment Fix for Vite Installation Issue

## Problem Summary
The deployment was failing on Render.com due to two issues:
1. Vite was not being installed because `NODE_ENV=production` was preventing npm from installing devDependencies
2. Vite doesn't support the `--verbose` flag, causing the build command to fail

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Environment Variable Conflict**: Setting `NODE_ENV=production` during build causes npm to skip devDependencies
2. **Vite is a devDependency**: Build tools like Vite are typically in devDependencies
3. **npm ci behavior**: With `NODE_ENV=production`, npm ci defaults to `--production=true`, excluding devDependencies
4. **Vite CLI flags**: Vite doesn't support `--verbose` flag, causing build failure
5. **ES Module issues**: `__dirname` not available in ES modules, requiring fixes in vite.config.ts

## Solution Implemented

### New Render-Specific Build Script
Created `render-build.sh` with the following key features:

1. **No NODE_ENV during build**: Removed `export NODE_ENV=production` to allow devDependency installation
2. **Explicit dev inclusion**: Uses `npm ci --include=dev` to force devDependency installation
3. **Multiple fallback strategies**: Four different methods to execute Vite build
4. **Comprehensive verification**: Checks for Vite installation in multiple ways
5. **Enhanced debugging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Key Changes:
```bash
# OLD (fails):
export NODE_ENV=production
npm ci --verbose

# NEW (works):
# Don't set NODE_ENV during build
npm ci --include=dev --verbose
```

## Deployment Instructions

### For Render.com:
1. In your Render dashboard, update the Build Command to:
   ```
   ./render-build.sh
   ```

2. Ensure Node.js version is set to 22.x

3. Do NOT set NODE_ENV in the build environment variables

### Alternative Commands:
- Standard build: `npm run build`
- Render-specific: `npm run build:render`
- Enhanced build: `npm run build:render:enhanced`

## Verification Steps
The script performs multiple checks:
1. Verifies Vite in npm list
2. Checks for Vite binary in node_modules/.bin
3. Verifies Vite package in node_modules
4. Reports Vite version if found

## Build Execution Strategies
The script tries multiple methods in order:
1. `npx vite build` (standard)
2. `./node_modules/.bin/vite build` (direct binary)
3. `vite build` (global command)
4. `node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build` (direct node execution)

## Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:
1. Check Render logs for specific error messages
2. Verify client/package.json has vite in devDependencies
3. Clear build cache in Render dashboard
4. Check Node.js version compatibility

### Common Issues:
- **Missing vite**: Ensure it's in client/package.json devDependencies
- **Cache issues**: Clear npm cache with `npm cache clean --force`
- **Wrong Node version**: Use Node.js 18.x or higher

## Why This Works
- Render sets NODE_ENV=production at runtime (for the running app)
- Build time should not have NODE_ENV=production (to install build tools)
- The `--include=dev` flag explicitly tells npm to install devDependencies
- Multiple fallback strategies ensure the build can proceed even with edge cases

## Files Modified
- Created: `render-build.sh` - Render-specific build script (removed --verbose flag)
- Updated: `package.json` - Added build:render script pointing to new file
- Updated: `client/vite.config.ts` - Fixed __dirname usage for ES modules
- Existing: `client/package.json` - Already has proper vite configuration

This fix ensures reliable Vite installation and builds on Render.com while maintaining proper separation between build-time and runtime environments.
