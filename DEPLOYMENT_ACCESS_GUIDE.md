# OneKeel Swarm - Deployment Access Guide

## üåê Production URL
https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com

## üîê Accessing the Application

### 1. Initial Login
Since the JWT token has expired, you'll need to log in again:

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Login URL:** https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com/login

### 2. Common Issues & Solutions

#### JWT Expired Error
This is normal after deployment. Simply log in again to get a fresh token.

#### "No tenant context established" Warning
This warning appears because the system supports multi-tenancy but is running in single-tenant mode. This is expected and doesn't affect functionality.

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Test Authentication
```bash
# Login to get a new token
curl -X POST https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'

# Save the token from the response
export TOKEN="your-jwt-token-here"
```

### 2. Test Campaign Creation
```bash
# Create a test campaign
curl -X POST https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com/api/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Campaign",
    "context": "Testing the deployed system",
    "handover_goals": "Verify deployment is working"
  }'
```

### 3. Access the Web Interface
1. Navigate to https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com
