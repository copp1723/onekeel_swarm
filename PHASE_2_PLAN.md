# Phase 2 Implementation Plan - Intelligent Workflow Automation

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on implementing intelligent workflow automation features based on user priorities. These features enable sophisticated, automated lead nurturing and cross-channel campaign coordination.

## Priority Features (In Order)

### 1. Conditional Logic System (If/Then Branching)
**Purpose:** Enable dynamic workflows that adapt based on lead behavior and data

#### Implementation Details:
- **Workflow Builder UI**
  - Visual flow editor with drag-and-drop conditions
  - Condition types: Lead properties, behavior triggers, time-based, engagement metrics
  - Actions: Route to agent, send message, update lead, wait, branch
  
- **Condition Engine**
  ```typescript
  interface WorkflowCondition {
    type: 'property' | 'behavior' | 'time' | 'engagement';
    operator: 'equals' | 'contains' | 'greater_than' | 'less_than' | 'exists';
    field: string;
    value: any;
    combineWith?: 'AND' | 'OR';
  }
  ```

- **Example Workflows:**
  - If lead opens email → Send SMS follow-up after 2 hours
  - If lead has high engagement score → Route to human agent
  - If lead location = "California" → Use CA-specific messaging

### 2. Automated Agent Handoffs
**Purpose:** Seamlessly transition leads between channels based on engagement

#### Implementation Details:
- **Handoff Rules Engine**
  - Define triggers for agent transitions
  - Preserve conversation context across channels
  - Intelligent routing based on agent availability/expertise

- **Handoff Scenarios:**
  - Email no response (3 days) → SMS agent takes over
  - SMS engagement high → Chat agent for real-time conversation
  - Chat qualified lead → Human agent for closing
  
- **Context Preservation**
  ```typescript
  interface HandoffContext {
    leadId: string;
    conversationHistory: Message[];
    leadScore: number;
    previousAgents: string[];
    handoffReason: string;
    metadata: Record<string, any>;
  }
  ```

### 3. Trigger System
**Purpose:** Automate campaign actions based on events, time, or conditions

#### Implementation Details:
- **Trigger Types:**
  - **Time-based:** Schedule actions (daily, weekly, specific dates)
  - **Event-based:** Lead actions (opened, clicked, replied, visited)
  - **Condition-based:** Lead properties meet criteria
  - **External:** Webhook events, API calls

- **Trigger Configuration**
  ```typescript
  interface Trigger {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    type: 'time' | 'event' | 'condition' | 'webhook';
    config: TriggerConfig;
    actions: TriggerAction[];
    active: boolean;
  }
  ```

- **Example Triggers:**
  - New lead added → Start welcome sequence
  - Lead score > 80 → Priority notification
  - 7 days no engagement → Re-engagement campaign

### 4. Cross-Channel Coordination
**Purpose:** Orchestrate unified campaigns across email, SMS, and chat

#### Implementation Details:
- **Campaign Orchestrator**
  - Central coordinator for multi-channel campaigns
  - Channel preference learning
  - Message frequency governance
  
- **Channel Optimization**
  - Track channel performance per lead
  - Auto-adjust channel mix based on engagement
  - Prevent message fatigue across channels

- **Unified Timeline**
  ```typescript
  interface CrossChannelCampaign {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    channels: ChannelConfig[];
    coordinationRules: CoordinationRule[];
    globalFrequencyCap: FrequencyCap;
  }
  ```

### 5. Journey Mapping
**Purpose:** Visual representation of lead progression through nurturing workflows

#### Implementation Details:
- **Journey Builder**
  - Visual canvas for designing lead journeys
  - Drag-and-drop stages and actions
  - Real-time journey analytics
  
- **Journey Components:**
  - Entry points (triggers)
  - Decision points (conditions)
  - Actions (messages, waits, handoffs)
  - Exit criteria

- **Journey Analytics**
  - Conversion funnel visualization
  - Drop-off analysis
  - A/B testing support
  - Time-in-stage metrics

### 6. Intelligent Lead Nurturing Examples
**Purpose:** Pre-built, customizable workflows for common scenarios

#### Pre-built Workflows:

1. **Welcome Series**
   - Day 0: Welcome email
   - Day 2: SMS if no email open
   - Day 5: Educational content
   - Day 7: Special offer

2. **Re-engagement Campaign**
   - Identify dormant leads (30+ days)
   - Send win-back email
   - SMS follow-up if no response
   - Final attempt via chat widget

3. **High-Intent Fast Track**
   - Detect high engagement signals
   - Immediate SMS outreach
   - Calendar booking link
   - Human agent notification

4. **Geographic Campaigns**
   - Location-based messaging
   - Local event invitations
   - Region-specific offers
   - Dealer proximity alerts

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Workflow definitions
CREATE TABLE workflows (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  trigger_config JSONB,
  conditions JSONB,
  actions JSONB,
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Workflow executions
CREATE TABLE workflow_executions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  workflow_id UUID REFERENCES workflows(id),
  lead_id UUID,
  status VARCHAR(50),
  current_step JSONB,
  context JSONB,
  started_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Agent handoffs
CREATE TABLE agent_handoffs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  lead_id UUID,
  from_agent_id UUID,
  to_agent_id UUID,
  handoff_reason VARCHAR(255),
  context JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Workflow Management
POST   /api/workflows              // Create workflow
GET    /api/workflows              // List workflows
GET    /api/workflows/:id          // Get workflow details
PUT    /api/workflows/:id          // Update workflow
DELETE /api/workflows/:id          // Delete workflow
POST   /api/workflows/:id/activate // Activate workflow

// Workflow Execution
GET    /api/workflows/:id/executions     // List executions
GET    /api/workflows/executions/:id     // Get execution details
POST   /api/workflows/:id/test          // Test workflow with sample data

// Journey Analytics
GET    /api/journeys/:id/analytics      // Journey performance
GET    /api/journeys/:id/funnel        // Conversion funnel
```
