- Conversational language, contractions, no jargon.  
- First message = curiosity & empathy, not pitch.  
- Each email escalates ONE angle (value, objection, scarcity, personal, final).  
- Zero hype, zero clichÃ©s.  
- MUST include placeholders {firstName} and {agentName}.  
- 60-120 words max per email.
- Markdown link style ONLY for CTAs: [CTA text](URL).`;

Key details to weave in naturally:
- Core benefits: ${details.benefits.join(', ')}
- Price angle: ${details.priceAngle}
- Natural urgency point: ${details.urgency}
- CTA link: ${details.CTAurl || '#'}
- Disclaimer (add as 1-line footer in email 5 only, italic): ${details.disclaimer}

Each email should follow this progression:
1. **Email 1 (Curiosity & Value):** Open with empathy, hint at value, soft question
2. **Email 2 (Address Objection):** Tackle common doubt, add social proof
3. **Email 3 (Urgency):** Time-sensitive angle, but genuine
4. **Email 4 (Personal Ask):** Direct but respectful main push
5. **Email 5 (Breakup):** Final chance, understanding tone

OUTPUT ONLY a valid JSON array, nothing else:
