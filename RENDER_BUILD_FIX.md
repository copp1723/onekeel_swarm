# Render Build Fix - Root Dependencies Not Installing

## Problem Identified

The build was failing on Render with "esbuild: not found" error despite moving `esbuild` and `tsx` to dependencies. The issue was that Render was running `npm ci` in the client directory but NOT in the root directory before running the build command.

## Root Cause

The original build script:
```json
"build": "npm run build:client && npm run build:server"
```

This script assumed that root dependencies were already installed, but Render wasn't installing them before running the build command.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Main Build Script
Modified the `build` script to explicitly run `npm ci` in the root directory first:
```json
"build": "npm ci && npm run build:client && npm run build:server"
```

### 2. Added Alternative Scripts
Added backup options in case needed:
```json
"install:all": "npm ci && cd client && npm ci",
"build:render": "npm ci --production=false && npm run build:client && npm run build:server"
```

The `--production=false` flag ensures all dependencies (including devDependencies if needed) are installed.

### 3. Verified Setup
- ✅ `package-lock.json` exists in root directory
- ✅ `esbuild` and `tsx` are in dependencies (not devDependencies)
- ✅ Build script now explicitly installs root dependencies

## How to Deploy

1. **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Keep the current Render build command as `npm run build`
   - The updated script will now install root dependencies first

2. **Option 2**: If issues persist, update Render build command to `npm run build:render`
   - This uses the explicit `--production=false` flag

3. **Option 3**: If you need to manually install first, use:
   - Build Command: `npm run install:all && npm run build:server && npm run build:client`

## What This Fixes

- ✅ Ensures `esbuild` is available for the server build step
- ✅ Ensures `tsx` is available for runtime
- ✅ Properly installs all root dependencies before building
- ✅ Maintains the same build output structure

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes
2. Trigger a new build on Render
3. The build should now succeed with esbuild properly installed

The key insight was that Render's build process wasn't automatically running `npm install` or `npm ci` in the root directory, only in subdirectories when explicitly navigated to (like the client directory).
